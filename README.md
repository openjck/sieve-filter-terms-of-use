I don't care about your Terms of Use.

This is a [Sieve](https://proton.me/support/sieve-advanced-custom-filters)
filter which can be used to get rid of emails about terms of use, privacy
policies, and the like. The filter is imperfect and incomplete. Desperate
attempts from lawyers to tell you that _something changed_ will still get
through, and there may be some false positives. However, the filter will also
improve over time.

You may need to create a folder named _Bulk_ before this filter will work.
